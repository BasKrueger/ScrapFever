Scrap Fever was developed during my 3. Semester at the [S4G School for Games](https://www.school4games.net/) using C# and the Unity Engine. This project had quite a turbulent development with members leaving the team, multiple smaller and one major change in direction for both art and gamedesign.

Scrap Fever is a futuristic Survivor-Like set in a magma cave where runs only last 6 extremely varied minutes. You play as a robot with weapons that automatically fire at the next enemy. Defeated enemies leave crystals behind, collect enough of them to either get a new or unlock a completely new weapon. Combining lightning fast reflexes with strategically picking the correct upgrades is key to surviving these intense 6 Minutes.
Features include:
  - 10 different weapons
  - 3 Bosses with unique mechanics
  - 72 Achievments
  - multi-language support
